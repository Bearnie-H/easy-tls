// Package easytls and the rest of this library is intended to provide a simple interface for creating simple HTTP(S) Client/Server applications.
//
// This package provides a mechanism for preparing the tls.Config object of an http.Client or http.Server with common levels of enablement.  The TLSBundle object intends to simplify preparing and understanding what components are necessary in a standard TLS setup, instead of needing to understand the full settings of the tls.Config struct.
